%% Write a MATLAB script that calculates the mean and median of a sample of 100 uniform random
% numbers between 0 and 2 and the percentage of points in the sample that are greater than 1

function [avg, mid] = prob1(N, a, b)
% ==================================================================
% INPUTS:
%   N = (1xN double) Uniform Random numbers
%   a, b = (1x1 double) Range of values between a and b, where a < b
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   avg = (1x1 double) Mean
%   mid = (1x1 double) Median, where if the number of values is EVEN, the
%   middle two will be AVERAGED
% ==================================================================
